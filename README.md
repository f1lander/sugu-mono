# Codename Sugu
This is a monorepo for the Sugu Marketplace. It contains the codebase for all the projects which are sugu-services (backend), sugu-mobile (mobile app) and sugu-ui (web app).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For the time being, setup instructions are aimed for MacOS, if you make it work on Windows, please update the corresponding sections. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the projects to the different environments.

### Prerequisites
The following repo has extra configuration for Visual Studio Code as the editor, however this doesn't mean that you can't use your favorite code editor. Also, most of the setup has been done with MacOS X in mind, most of the things might work in a Linux development environment. On Windows though, some tweaks will have to be made.

You will need to have `NodeJS`  **v12.x** running in your development environment, we suggest you also setup `nvm` to manage different `nodejs` versions. Also this monorepo relies on `yarn` to handle workspaces. Projects are setup to use `docker`, except `sugu-mobile`.

### Installing

- Installing `node`
	- Please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) (do not use `brew`).

- Installing yarn (you must have brew)
```
brew update && brew install yarn
```
- Installing docker
	- Please follow these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### For React Native (Expo) `sugu-mobile` project

- Installing `expo` - _you might also need to open an account in expo.io._
```
yarn global add expo-cli
```
- Install `watchman`
```
brew install watchman
```
>For reference purpose, initial setup was made following this [Medium post](https://medium.com/habilelabs/react-native-react-web-and-expo-together-in-one-monorepo-5b8f9a0fca00).

## Running the projects

Before anything, you need to get your `.env` file created with the correct environment variables in `sugu-services`, please ask your peers for this configuration.

After the `.env` file is setup, you need to build the images and run the containers. All of this is has been done using `docker-compose`. Run this command:
```
yarn run setup
```
Everytime you want to run the applications you can the following command which will start sugu-ui and sugu-services in :
```
yarn start
```
When npm packages are added, removed or changed, they need to be updated in the containers as well, to achieve this run this command everytime it happens:
```
yarn run update-packages
```

## Running the tests
All projects have tests setup with `jest`, hopefully we will have unit tests on most of our projects.

You can run tests on each repo like:
```
yarn workspace sugu-mobile run test
```

### Coding style
Coding style is enforced by `prettier` and `eslint`, both of them a formatter and a linter respectively. Each project has a `format` and a `lint` script that will run the specified task on their projects.

At the root of the monorepo, `husky` and `lintstaged` have been configured to check on the staged files before they are commited to git.

On top of that, Visual Studio extensions for `prettier` and `eslint` have been configured. When VS Code opens, it will suggest to install them if you don't have them.

Running format:
```
yarn workspace <package name> run format
```

Running linter:
```
yarn workspace <package name> run lint
```
